\begin{vbframe}{Handling of categorical features}

Suppose a feature $x_j \in \{1, \dots, G\}$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two common options for encoding the categorical feature $x_j$ in a base learner $b_j$ are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
        One base learner to simultaneously estimate all categories: 
        $$b_j(x_j | \thetab_j) = \sum_{g=1}^G \theta_{j,g}\mathds{1}_{\{g = x_j\}} = (\mathds{1}_{\{x_j = 1\}}, ..., \mathds{1}_{\{x_j = G\}}) \thetab_j$$
        Hence, $b_j$ incorporates a one-hot encoded feature with group means $\thetab\in\R^G$ as estimates. 
    
    \item 
        One binary base learner per category:
        $$b_{j,g}(x_j | \theta_{j,g}) = \theta_{j,g}\mathds{1}_{\{g = x_j\}}$$  
        Including all categories of the feature means adding $G$ base learners $b_{j,1}, \dots, b_{j,G}$ with each accounting for one specific class.
  \end{itemize}
  %\item The \texttt{compboost} package currently implements the first variant.
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\framebreak

Advantages within CWB of simultaneously handling all categories: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Much faster estimation process compared to adding the categories as individual binary base learners.

    \item 
        Explicit solution of $\thetabh = \argmin_{\thetab\in\R^G}\sumin (\yi - b_j(x^{(i)}_j | \thetab))^2$ with:
        $$\thetabh = (\thetah_1, \dots, \thetah_G)^T,\ \thetah_g = n_g^{-1}\sumin \yi \mathds{1}_{\{x^{(i)}_j = g\}}$$

    \item 
        Adding regularization is easy by reframing the base learner as a linear model and using, e.g., Ridge regression for estimating $\thetabh$.  
\end{itemize}

Disadvantage within CWB of simultaneously handling all categories: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        If class $g^\ast\in\{1, \dots, G\}$ is not informative, the respective parameter estimate $\thetah_{g^\ast}$ is (almost sure) not $0$.
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\framebreak

Advantages within CWB of including categories individually: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        A finer selection within the feature is possible since non-informative categories are simply not included in the model and hence have an effect of $0$.

    \item 
        Explicit solution of $\thetah_{j,g} = \argmin_{\theta\in\R}\sumin (\yi - b_g(x^{(i)}_j|\theta))^2$ with:
        $$\thetah_{j,g} = n_g^{-1}\sumin \yi \mathds{1}_{\{x^{(i)}_j = g\}}$$
\end{itemize}

Disadvantage within CWB of simultaneously handling all categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Fitting CWB is much slower due to the overhead in each iteration (updating the model, pseudo residuals, and doing the base learner selection) after conducting one tiny step into the direction of the 1-dim parameter $\thetah_{j,g}$.

    \item 
        The base learner has exactly one degree of freedom which makes penalization and a fair selection very hard if not impossible.
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{vbframe}{intercept handling}

\begin{itemize}
  %\item The loss-optimal constant $\fm[0](\xv)$ is an initial model intercept.
  %\item An intercept is often referred to as part of a model which contains information independent of the features.
  \item Suppose linear base learners $b_j(\xv) = \theta_{j1} + \theta_{j2} x_j$ with one intercept $\theta_{j1}$ per base learner and slope $\theta_{j2}$.
  \item If base learner $\hat{b}_j$ with parameter estimates $\thetamh[1] = (\hat{\theta}_{j1}^{[1]}, \hat{\theta}_{j1}^{[1]})$ is selected in the first iteration consequently updates the model intercept to $\fm[0](\xv) + \hat{\theta}_{j1}^{[1]}$.
  \item Throughout the fitting process, the intercept is adjusted $M$ times to its final form:
    $$
    \fm[0](\xv) + \sum\limits_{m=1}^M \hat{\theta}^{[m]}_{j^{[m]}1}
    $$
\end{itemize}
$\Rightarrow$ All intercepts in the base learners are collected and aggregated to one model intercept.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\framebreak

Two possible options to handle the intercept in CWB are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Include an intercept base learner:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add base learner $b_{\text{int}} = \theta$ as potential candidate considered in each iteration.
    \item At the same time, remove the intercept from all linear base learners to only use $b_j(\xv) = \theta_j x_j$.
    \item The final intercept is given by $\fm[0](\xv) + \hat{\theta}$.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Include an intercept in each linear base learner $b_j(\xv) = \theta_{j1} + \theta_{j2} x_j$ and accumulate all intercepts to one global intercept after the fitting.

\end{itemize}

\begin{vbframe}{Example: Life expectancy}

Consider the \texttt{life expectancy} (data set is provided by the WHO and is available on Kaggle: \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who}) regression task, for which we fit a
CWB model with linear base learners (with intercept) to predict the life expectancy:

\begin{table}
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
    \textbf{variable} & \textbf{description} \\
    \hline
    \texttt{Life.expectancy} & Life expectancy in years \\	
    \hline
    \texttt{Country}         & The country (just a selection GER, USE, SWE, ZAF, and ETH\\
    \texttt{Year}            & The recorded year\\
    \texttt{BMI}             & Average $\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{body weight in kg}}{(\text{Height in m})^2}$ in a year and country\\
    \texttt{Adult.Mortality} & Adult Mortality Rates of both sexes (probability of dying between 15 \\
                             & and 60 years per 1000 population)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Using \texttt{compboost} with $M = 150$ iterations, we can visualize which base learner was selected when and how the estimated feature effects evolve over time.
